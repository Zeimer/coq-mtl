(** We will reason by functional extensionality quite a lot. For this, we
    have quite a few tactics:
    - [ext x] is a shorthand for [extensionality x]
    - [ext2], [ext3] and [ext4] are analogous, but for more arguments
    - [ext] is [ext x], where [x] is a freshly generated name
    - [exts] is repeated [ext] *)

(** [Program.Basics] has the rest of the things we need, namely [id] and

(** We will need some obvious lemmas about [id]. *)
Lemma id_eq :
  forall (A : Type) (x : A), id x = x.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Lemma id_left :
  forall (A B : Type) (f : A -> B),

Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Our automation tactics are based based on [autorewrite] and
    [autounfold]. These two repeatedly rewrite/unfold all things they
    find in their hint databases. Throughout the library, we will need
    to mark which lemmas and definitions we want rewritten/unfolded.

    We need to make sure the rewriting doesn't loop and that unfolding
    doesn't prevent rewriting. In practice, this is very straightforward.
    We will only add as hints those lemmas that "simplify", in some
    sense, the theorem's statement. Since rewriting is performed before
    unfolding, we don't need to worry about it breaking anything.

    Both our main rewriting and unfolding hint databases are named
    [CoqMTL], but there are some minor ones, like [Functor] and
    [Functor']. *)
#[global] Hint Rewrite @id_eq @id_left @id_right : CoqMTL.

    to define a dummy value and add it to the unfolding database in order

(** [umatch] is a tactic for conveniently [destruct]ing nested pattern

| x : unit |- _ => destruct x
| |- context [match ?x with _ => _ end] => unmatch x
end.

(** A basic simplification tactic that goes like this:
    - do some computations and introduce hypotheses into the context
    - if the goal is of the form [f = g] for some functions [f] and [g],
      reason by functional extensionality
    - destruct whatever possible

    - introduce quantified variables/hypotheses into context
    - unfold definitions using the unfold hint database [CoqMTL]
    - rewrite using the rewrite hint database [CoqMTL]
    - try to finish the goal by unfolding some sensitive definitions
      and reason by [congruence] and [reflexivity] (interestingly,
      [congruence] can't solve some goals that [reflexivity] can)
