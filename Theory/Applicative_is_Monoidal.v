(** A proof of the fact the [Applicative] functors are the same thing
    as [Monoidal] functors. *)

From CoqMTL Require Export Control.Applicative.
From CoqMTL Require Export Control.Monoidal.

(** We cat define [pure] by mapping a constant function over the default
    computation. *)
Definition pure_Monoidal
  {F : Type -> Type} {inst : Monoidal F} {A : Type} (x : A) : F A :=
    fmap (fun u : unit => x) default.

(** We can define [ap] by pairing f with a and mapping over it with a
    function which applies the first component of the pair to the
    second component. *)
Definition ap_Monoidal
  {F : Type -> Type} {inst : Monoidal F} {A B : Type}
  (f : F (A -> B)) (a : F A) : F B :=
    fmap (fun p => apply (fst p) (snd p)) (pairF f a).

(** The direction [Monoidal] => [Applicative] was very hard for me to
    prove. After unfolding definitions, the easy part is taken care of
    by the tactic [monoidal]. The rest is mostly precisely tailored
    rewrites in the reverse direction. If you gazed at the goals for
    long enough, you could probably have proved this all by yourself,
    but thanks to me you don't need to... *)

(** The proof is quite easy, nothing to see here.
    Note that [fmap_pure_ap] is not necessary in the big rewrite
    alternative ||, but the tactic [hs] uses it, so it's necessary
    to prove the equivalence. *)
