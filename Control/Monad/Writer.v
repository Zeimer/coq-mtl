(** [Writer W A] represents a computation that returns a result of type [A]
    and has access to a log of messages of type [W]. [W] is a monoid whose
    operation represents the concatenation of messages. *)

(** We can map over [Writer W A] by applying the function to the result of
    the computation, without touching the log. *)

(** We can apply a computation which returns a function to a computation

    the argument and concatenating the produced logs (first the log of
    the function, then the log of the argument). *)

Lemma Writer_not_CommutativeApplicative :
  ~ (forall W : Monoid, CommutativeApplicative _ (Applicative_Writer W)).
Proof.
  intro. destruct (H (Monoid_list_app bool)). unfold Writer in ap_comm.
  specialize (ap_comm nat nat nat (fun _ => id)
    (42, [true; false]) (43, [false; true])).

(** [Writer W] also doesn't always have [Alternative] structure, because
    it's argument may be an empty type. There's probably no simple way
    to fix this like in the case of [CommutativeApplicative]. *)

Proof.

(** We can bind a computation to a function which returns a computation
    by first computing the argument and then running the computation
    returned by the function. In the meantime, we concatenate the logs. *)
